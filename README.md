## Why CodeMie CLI?

CodeMie CLI is the all-in-one AI coding assistant for developers.

- ✨ **One CLI, Multiple AI Agents** - Switch between Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Deep Agents, and built-in agent.
- 🔄 **Multi-Provider Support** - OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, LiteLLM, Ollama, and Enterprise SSO.
- 🚀 **Built-in Agent** - A powerful LangGraph-based assistant with file operations, command execution, and planning tools.
- 🖥️ **Cross-Platform** - Full support for Windows, Linux, and macOS with platform-specific optimizations.
- 🔐 **Enterprise Ready** - SSO authentication, audit logging, and role-based access.
- ⚡ **Productivity Boost** - Code review, refactoring, test generation, and bug fixing.
- 🎯 **Profile Management** - Manage work, personal, and team configurations separately.
- 📊 **Usage Analytics** - Track and analyze AI usage across all agents with detailed insights.
- 🔧 **CI/CD Workflows** - Automated code review, fixes, and feature implementation.

Perfect for developers seeking a powerful alternative to GitHub Copilot or Cursor.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install globally for best experience
npm install -g @codemieai/code

# 1. Setup (interactive wizard)
codemie setup

# 2. Check system health
codemie doctor

# 3. Install an external agent (e.g., Claude Code)
codemie install claude

# 4. Use the installed agent
codemie-claude "Review my API code"

# 5. Use the built-in agent
codemie-code "Analyze this codebase"

# 6. Execute a single task and exit
codemie --task "Generate unit tests"
```

**Prefer not to install globally?** Use npx with the full package name:

```bash
npx @codemieai/code setup
npx @codemieai/code doctor
npx @codemieai/code install claude
# Note: Agent shortcuts require global installation
```

## Installation

### Global Installation (Recommended)

For the best experience with all features and agent shortcuts:

```bash
npm install -g @codemieai/code
codemie --help
```

### Local/Project Installation

For project-specific usage:

```bash
npm install @codemieai/code

# Use with npx
npx @codemieai/code --help
```

**Note:** Agent shortcuts (`codemie-claude`, `codemie-code`, etc.) require global installation.

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codemie-ai/codemie-code.git
cd codemie-code
npm install
npm run build && npm link
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
codemie --help
codemie doctor
```

## Usage

The CodeMie CLI provides two ways to interact with AI agents:

### Built-in Agent (CodeMie Native)

The built-in agent is ready to use immediately and is great for a wide range of coding tasks.

**Available Tools:**
- `read_file` - Read file contents
- `write_file` - Write content to files
- `list_directory` - List files with intelligent filtering (auto-filters node_modules, .git, etc.)
- `execute_command` - Execute shell commands with progress tracking
- `write_todos` / `update_todo_status` / `append_todo` / `clear_todos` / `show_todos` - Planning and progress tracking tools

```bash
# Start an interactive conversation
codemie-code

# Start with an initial message
codemie-code "Help me refactor this component"
```

### External Agents

You can also install and use external agents like Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, and Deep Agents.

**Available Agents:**
- **Claude Code** (`codemie-claude`) - Anthropic's official CLI with advanced code understanding
- **Codex** (`codemie-codex`) - OpenAI's code generation specialist
- **Gemini CLI** (`codemie-gemini`) - Google's Gemini for coding tasks
- **Deep Agents** (`codemie-deepagents`) - Advanced multi-agent system with specialized roles

```bash
# Install an agent
codemie install claude

# Use the agent
codemie-claude "Review my API code"

# Install Python-based agent (uses pip/uv)
codemie install deepagents
codemie-deepagents "Implement a REST API"
```

For more detailed information on the available agents, see the [Agents Documentation](docs/AGENTS.md).

## Commands

The CodeMie CLI has a rich set of commands for managing agents, configuration, and more.

```bash
codemie setup            # Interactive configuration wizard
codemie list             # List all available agents
codemie install <agent>  # Install an agent
codemie profile          # Manage provider profiles
codemie analytics        # View usage analytics (sessions, tokens, costs, tools)
codemie workflow <cmd>   # Manage CI/CD workflows
codemie doctor           # Health check and diagnostics
```

For a full command reference, see the [Commands Documentation](docs/COMMANDS.md).
