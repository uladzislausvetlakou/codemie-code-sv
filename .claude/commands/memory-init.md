# Initialize Memory Documentation for Directory

**Instructions:**

Focus on the specified directory $ARGUMENTS or the current working directory:

1. **Investigate Architecture**: Analyze the implementation principles and architecture of the code in this directory and its subdirectories. Look for:
   - Design patterns being used
   - Dependencies and their purposes
   - Key abstractions and interfaces
   - Naming conventions and code organization

2. **Create or Update Documentation**: Create a CLAUDE.md file capturing this knowledge. If one already exists, update it with newly discovered information. Include:
   - Purpose and responsibility of this module
   - Key architectural decisions
   - Important implementation details
   - Common patterns used throughout the code
   - Any gotchas or non-obvious behaviors
